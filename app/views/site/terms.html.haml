      %span{:style => "text-decoration: underline;"} Scope
    %p Kids Go Mobile’s service allows parents to monitor their children’s Internet, mobile phone and online device usage. This Agreement describes the terms governing your use of the Kids Go Mobile services provided to you, including content, updates and new releases and (collectively, the “Services”). This Agreement expressly includes and incorporates by reference:
    %ul
      %li Kids Go Mobile’s Privacy Policy
      %li Any terms provided separately to you for the Services, including for example, web or email product or program terms, ordering, activation, pricing and payment terms, if applicable, for the Services.
    %p Overview of the Services
    %p When you use the Services you create a profile and add account information for online services, mobile telephone and other mobile device accounts belonging to you (the “Linked Accounts”). Kids Go Mobile will connect to the Linked Accounts and will provide you with software to install on your mobile phone(s) or other devices. When you add Linked Accounts and install the mobile device software, Kids Go Mobile will import personal information from those accounts and devices, including a record of activities conducted on and contacts made through those accounts and devices (collectively “Account Activity”) so that you may monitor your children’s activities. The Services also include public forums where you may interact with other users of the Services and upload or publicly post information, text, images, video or other materials (collectively “Public Content”).
    %p You are the Legal Owner of the Linked Accounts
    %p You warrant and represent to us that you own the Linked Accounts. Specifically, although Linked Accounts may be established in the names and using credentials for your minor children, you warrant and represent to us that you are the legal owner of all Linked Accounts and you have the legal authority to connect the Linked Accounts to the Services. You agree that it is your sole responsibility to ensure that all accounts used by your children that you wish to monitor are set up as Linked Accounts. Additionally, you agree that various laws may apply to the monitoring of Linked Accounts and that it is your sole responsibility to ensure compliance with any such laws and that Kids Go Mobile expressly disclaims any duty or obligation to do so.
    %p Limitations of the Services
    %p There are natural limitations to the effectiveness of the services provided by Kids Go Mobile. You acknowledge that the services;
    %ul
      %li Are designed to help you monitor your children’s Internet, online and mobile activities and identify potentially risky or troubling trends or behavior based on patterns in your children’s Internet, online and mobile usage; and
      %li Are highly dependent on your efforts to ensure that all Internet, mobile, and online devices and accounts used by your children are set up Linked Accounts.
    %p Additionally, the Services are not, and should not be presumed to be, a substitute for:
    %ul
      %li Active involvement by you in your children’s online and offline lives and activities; and
      %li Direct, active oversight and supervision of your children and of their Internet, mobile phone, and online device usage.
    %p Furthermore, while Kids Go Mobile is pleased to make the Services available to you, use of the Services does not guarantee the safety of your children and we cannot assure you that by using the Services your children will be protected from online predators and other hazards. Among other things, this is because: (a) we may not have access to all accounts and devices used by your children (and your children also may use accounts and devices of friends or acquaintances to mask or hide certain activities and communications) and therefore have no way to assure you that all of their Internet, mobile, and online, activities are being monitored, even if you believe that they are; (b) sufficient data may not be available based on your children’s usage of Internet, mobile, and online devices and communications; (c) online predators have become (and will continue to become) increasingly sophisticated in their tactics, use of technology, and efforts to mask their activities and defeat parental and other monitoring efforts, and (d) your children may have only limited Internet, mobile or online contact with potential predators or online threats and may encounter or deal with them in offline or unmonitored electronic environments that the Services are not capable of monitoring,
    %p In light of these and other limitations, we strongly encourage you (beyond using the Services) to:
    %ul
      %li Proactively engage with your children on a regular basis and stay informed about both their online and offline activities.
      %li Set and adhere to policies and boundaries for their use of Internet, mobile, and online devices and consider the use of “technology use agreements” or guidelines with your children. Our website contains some samples that might be useful in this regard, which can be accessed by clicking this link, and are subject to the additional limitations and disclaimers described in the web pages relating to these materials
      %li Listen to your instincts and actively evaluate any warning signs you see, whether flagged by the Services or observed by you through direct interaction with your children or other means.
    %p Your Rights To Use The Services And Restrictions
